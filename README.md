# RNN-Tagger on Windows

## Usage

Here you find batch scripts that can be used with RNN-Tagger developed by Helmut Schmid (see SCHMID 2019 as well as https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/RNNTagger/). Just locate the batch script in the `cmd` folder of RNN-Tagger (where you can find the corresponding shell scripts).

Then you can execute the batch file using cmd (or Power Shell) in `cmd` folder: `xxx.bat Text.txt` where `Text.txt` represents the text file you want to be analyzed.

At the moment, we offer only Old Italian. Further batch files for additional languages will be made available soon.

## Prerequisities

Please make sure that Python is installed on your system (https://www.python.org/downloads/). We used Python 3.12, which works perfectly.

Please make sure that Perl is installed on your system. We used Strawberry Perl (https://strawberryperl.com/).
